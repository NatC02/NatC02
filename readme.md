## We all have our own unique quirks! For some, it's the way they talk, for others, the way they dress. For developers, it's their Github profiles.
Oh yeah, I haven't even said my name?
Well, I'm Natan Ceballos and I like to develop software. 

It's as simple as that.

I'm currently studying Computer Science at New Jersey City University.

I'm a **Freelance Web Developer** and **Front End Software Engineer** at [Bhorosha Nonprofit Corganization](https://bhoroshabangladesh.mystrikingly.com/).

I'm passionate about **Front End & Backend** development and **love** to **write code**.

## Hobbies and Interests

At the moment, I'm a big fan of "Masters of Scale." Someone recommended it to me, so I thought I should give it a listen. It's a fantastic podcast in which the host interviews entrepreneurs who tell how they grew their company from nothing to something great!

Juggling and learning how to solve Sudoku puzzles every once in a blue moon.

My favorite Twitch streamer is [MoistCritikal](https://www.twitch.tv/moistcr1tikal), and he has something new going on with each of his broadcasts! That said, I only tune in to his "YouTube Night" streams.
